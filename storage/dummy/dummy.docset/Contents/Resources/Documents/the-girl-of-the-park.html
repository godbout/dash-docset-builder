    <h1>The girl of the park</h1>
    <p>HOW MANY TIMES WILL I HAVE TO REPEAT IT???!!!<br>
DO I LOOK LIKE A FOOL OR WHAT?!<br>
FUCK IT.  </p>
<p>It's not complicated.<br>
When you cross the street, you watch BOTH WAYS!!!<br>
It's FUCKING simple.<br>
Think of it, the ratio, simplicity over safety, nothing can beat that!!!<br>
You watch, you save your life.<br>
Fuck.  </p>
<p>I still don't understand people you know. From where do they get that I'm fucking annoying with that? It's just discrimination.<br>
I believe it. I hate it but I believe it.<br>
I'm too tall, I'm too slim. I look like nothing and that's enough to make me a 'boring' person.  </p>
<p>Where is this world going, honestly?  </p>
<p>This morning, she was crossing the park, going to the uni. She was thinking that she should walk faster, and also who's gonna eat with her at noon.<br>
Then she put one foot on the road. She looked on the right but hey, girl, here it's the left that you have to care about.<br>
Actually it's BOTH WAYS.<br>
Yeah.<br>
Boring.<br>
Fuck off.  </p>
<p>She didn't even notice she was staring at the back of the cars.<br>
Second foot on the road.<br>
Then third. I mean, third step.<br>
That's when the motorbike decided to make a strike. The guy flew. Literally. It could have been funny if his head didn't end up in the rear of this taxi.<br>
The girl moved also.<br>
I felt like in a dream. Not even a nightmare, just a dream, hoping to wake up with a smile because everything is just fantasy.<br>
I ran. I took her in my arms. Usually I'm a shy guy. Well, I guess that when you start forgetting about yourself, that's what happens, you take girls in your arms!<br>
The first thing she told me was 'hey, still alive!' with a smile. She really believed she was ok.  Well, baby, you see 10 meters away? Your legs. Yeah, true, actually there's still this 'tube' linking the two parts (I'm not a doctor but it looks like an intestine, sorry) but see the cars there? I don't think they're gonna stop for you...<br>
Well, I'm not a bad guy. I just told this to myself, and smiled back.<br>
Then she said that we should get a coffee once she'll be back on her legs. I smiled once again, but I think she got that this one was faked.<br>
Then she cried, and left.  </p>
<p>Did you know you could live 5 minutes in 2 parts?  </p>
<p>I rose my head, and felt resigned. I didn't even cry.<br>
I saw the driver of the motorbike. Didn't know people got so much blood.<br>
I didn't even cry. Neither vomit.</p>    <footer class="my-35 float-right">
