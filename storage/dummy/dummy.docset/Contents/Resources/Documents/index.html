    <h1>Slices (of You)</h1>
            <p>I'm the habitual me; minding my own business. I'm parked on the side of the road, front and rear lights on, warning indicators too. The engine is still warm. Mainly because it's running.</p>
<p>My girl just dropped off the motorbike to buy some stationeries. I see her slowly disappear into the womb of the shop. I am pleased.</p>
<p>I turn back my head in front of me, rest my elbows on the handlebar, and wait. No iPhone. No Kindle. No distractions. Staring straight ahead. Breathing. Being here. Now.</p>
<p>A guy is coming fast on my right, on the side path. Blond, tall, foreigner. He parks his motorbike a meter before me. A guy is coming fast on my right, on the side path. Blond, tall, foreigner. He parks his motorbike behind his friend, and zero meter next to me. I don't budge. He can't get off. I don't budge. He gets off and ram my right leg with his left foot. I ask him if he needs more space; he asks me if I have any problem. Today is not a good day to ask that question.</p>
<p>The two fanatics talk between themselves, show their teeth, pretend to be cool, and head towards me. I don't budge. Today is not a good day. I close my eyes, and sigh.</p>
<p>They come pushing me, shouting. They want to play, or so it seems.</p>
<p>I get up, put my motorbike on its side stand, and get closer to them, stoically. The first one swings a fist onto my face. I don't budge. I take it on the bone cheek that I hear cracking. I lean a bit on the right and below, but not because on his punch, rather because I'm going to land an uppercut on his balls. Done. I land another one right under his chin. His teeth shatter and fly away. The second pull out a knife from his back pocket. Today is not a good day. He looks cool but he's not. I approach him, again, stoically. He's not sure what to do. He swings the knife towards me and hits the left side of my belly. Without any reaction I land my hand on his, turn it 180 degrees, he screams and the knife falls down. I kick Second Blondie in the stomach and miss him. He seems to regain confidence but the missed kick makes me kneel on the ground, where I pick up the knife. I pierce his stomach once. Then twice. Then about twelve more times. He falls on the ground. I turn and plant the knife in the neck of the first guy, still lying on the ground. My girl is still not back.</p>
<p>I feel tired and resigned and also crazy. I start cutting up the Blondies Brothers ears and carve mountains shapes out of them. I slice the tip of their noses too just for fun. I'm thinking they can make some nice hide-nipples.</p>
<p>My girl is now back. The side path is red and has a strong smell of iron. It's the first time she sees me in this position. I stand up and smile. She smiles. We hug for ten seconds, under the cameras of unknown passersby. I give her a slight kiss. We hop on the motorbike and head away. She hugs me sweet and tight.</p>
<p>She's the one.</p>
