    <h1>Hero</h1>
    <p>The library is strangely quiet. Well, actually not strangely. It is supposed to be, right?</p>
<p>But the corner in which we can grab a coffee and do a little chitchat is silent too, and this is unusual.</p>
<p>Daily, at the time I arrive to get my shot of productivity, I  hear him. It is hard not to. I try to focus on my work but he's snorting every 10 seconds, and I'm not even exaggerating.</p>
<p>The thing is, believe me or not, on him, it is quite attractive. There's some lightness in his demeanor, like he's owning the place and nothing can disturb him.</p>
<p>But today, he's not there. At his table there are 7 women, looking at a phone, and a letter.</p>
<p>I knew this day would come.</p>
<p>At my first experience with the snorting, he was with a tall, slim one. Probably Mongolian. Tattooed. A real beauty. They were talking in Mandarin.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the conversation was in Portuguese. The lady, about 40. I couldn't catch it all, but they were arguing. Still, they left each other with a kiss on the lips.</p>
<p>And then it kept going, for almost a year.</p>
<p>Chinese students (speaking Portuguese). Tall mainlanders (speaking Mandarin). Locals (with their Cantonese). All subjugated. Or at least this is what I told myself, to make me feel better.</p>
<p>The truth? His charisma. A magnet. Even I had troubles staying away.</p>
<p>The last time was last week. He was snorting even more than usual. He dropped a tissue with a bit of blood on it. He was with the tall one I saw the first time. She was still beautiful.</p>
<p>I didn't count how many I saw during that year because it's none of my business, but what I can tell you is this: 19. Yep.</p>
<p>I've always wondered how he could juggle so well, and show not one ounce of worry, or guilt.</p>
<p>Now tears are rolling down the cheeks of each of these women. They probably know the truth now, but they are still tears of love.</p>
<p>I'm curious. I join the table.
I see the letter, and the phone.</p>
<p>I smile.</p>
<p>He's my hero.</p>    <footer class="my-35 float-right">
